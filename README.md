**Description:**
The SpringSurveyAPI project is a comprehensive implementation of a Survey REST API built on the robust and efficient Spring Boot framework. Aimed at providing a flexible and scalable solution for conducting surveys and collecting responses, this project leverages key components of the Spring ecosystem to ensure reliability, security, and ease of integration.

**Key Components and Features:**

1. **REST API:**
The core of the project is a RESTful API designed to handle survey-related operations. Endpoints are defined to create surveys, retrieve survey details, submit responses, and manage the overall survey lifecycle. The use of RESTful principles ensures a standardized and predictable interface for communication with the API.
2. **Spring Security:**
Security is a top priority in the SpringSurveyAPI project. Spring Security is integrated to manage authentication and authorization processes, safeguarding the API against unauthorized access and ensuring that only authenticated users with the appropriate roles can perform sensitive operations.
3. **Database Support with Spring JPA:**
Spring Data JPA is employed to interact with a relational database, allowing seamless storage and retrieval of survey data. JPA simplifies database operations, providing a high-level abstraction that allows developers to focus on the business logic rather than dealing with intricate database queries.
4. **Integration Test:**
The project includes a suite of integration tests to validate the functionality of the API in a real-world scenario. These tests ensure that the different components of the system work together seamlessly and that the API functions as expected during end-to-end interactions.
5. **Unit Test:**
Unit tests are implemented to validate the functionality of individual components and methods within the application. These tests focus on isolating and testing specific units of code to ensure that each part of the application performs as intended. Unit tests contribute to the overall reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

Note: This application is not designed for real production integration. It's only for educational purposes.
